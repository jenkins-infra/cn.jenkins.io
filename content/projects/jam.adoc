Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) are local meetups intended to bring Jenkins users
and contributors together for socializing and learning.
JAMs are organized by local Jenkins community members who have a passion for
sharing new Jenkins concepts, patterns and tools. JAMs can be found
link:http://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/[around the world], and if there isn't a
JAM in your city, you could be the one to start it!

Jenkins Area Meetups are driven by local organizers but receive support from
the Jenkins project via swag (stickers, etc), promotion, and help bootstrapping
and operating the meetup group.---

Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) 是本地化的沙龙活动，旨在聚集当地的 Jenkins 用户和贡献者并相互交流和学习。
JAM 通常由本地乐于分享 Jenkins 新概念、模式及工具的活跃 Jenkins 社区成员来组织。这里是 link:http://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/[全球的 JAM 沙龙活动] ，如果你所在的城市还没有 JAM ，那就从你开始组织第一次活动吧！

JAM 活动一般由本地组织者推动，但得到 Jenkins 项目的官方支持，比如纪念品（贴纸等）、推广以及帮助一步步组织并建立沙龙活动小组。

== 新手入门

在最开始请发送邮件到 jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com ，告知我们你希望举办 JAM 活动的城市。我们的团队将会在 meetup.com 上为你创建专用页面，并与你一起组织该 JAM 活动。

*JAM 支持*

* 纪念品 - 我们会提供很酷的纪念品（贴纸、T恤、Jenkins 玩偶等）分享给与会成员。
* 推广 - 我们为每一个 JAM 持续提供社交媒体支持，比如通过 Twitter、博客文章、Facebook、 通讯文章以及发布在 jenkinsci.org 网站的活动日历上。
* Jenkins 专家支持 - 我们会帮助你邀请一位 Jenkins 专家作为 JAM 活动的关键分享嘉宾，或者提供演讲资料。
* 拓展 - 我们会协助联络当地社区提供茶歇/场地赞助。

=== 最佳实践

* 加入现有沙龙活动小组并关注评估本地区的 Jenkins 热度和氛围。
* 联络现有 JAM 活动组织者并学习最佳实践和时间投入。
* 注册一个Twitter账户（比如 #JenkinsShenzhen）并将该 ID 以邮件形式发送至 jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com 以便我们帮助推广你的 JAM 活动。
* 提前推广、宣传并发布你的 JAM 活动。
* 避免产品偏见。保持纯粹，这不是促销活动，只是关于社区以及为社区提供的学习机会。
* 不限形式，比如有主题分享、小组讨论、圆桌论坛、工作坊、黑客马拉松等等。
* 设置统一的日期、时间和地点，方便与会成员制定参加计划。避免取消活动，否则人们可能失去信息而不再支持你的 JAM 活动。

=== 退出机制

如果你无法继续担任 JAM 活动组织者，我们希望你能指定一位候选的本地组织者。如果没有合适人选，请发送邮件到 jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com ，我们会与你一起寻找候选人。

== 支持一场 JAM 活动

如果你不能担任一名 JAM 活动组织者，也可以考虑提供分享嘉宾、茶歇或媒体记录赞助。如果你的公司有意赞助这些内容，可以直接发送邮件到 jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com 或者通过 meetup.com 联络当地的 JAM 活动组织者，或者填写 link:https://docs.google.com/a/cloudbees.com/forms/d/1dGpwxpwoJDHR3fTlIcFXO8GZVpx5i_dWUlbi9LKolX4/edit[这个表单] 。 

*赞助茶歇、场地或媒体记录的权益：*

* 活动网站上的 Logo 和链接展示。
* 主持人在活动开场/结束时的公开鸣谢。
* 提供展位来展示营销物料、标牌及纪念品等。
* Opportunity to host a drawing. 主持展览的机会。
* 社交媒体提及。
* 向参会者提供2分钟时间的介绍。

*茶歇赞助：*

在某些月份举行的沙龙活动需要赞助茶歇，根据参会人数不同花费一般在200到600美元。这些费用主要用于购买披萨、软饮和纸巾等。每场月度沙龙活动都需要一个赞助商。

*场地赞助：*

场地赞助商免费提供沙龙活动所需的基本场地设施。每次沙龙活动都需要一个场地赞助商。推荐使用带有椅子和几个6英尺长桌的会议室，带有可用于茶歇的开放空间，最好再有公共洗手间。一场沙龙活动还需要诸如投影仪等显示设备。对于一场超过50人参加的活动，还需要使用麦克风。

*摄录赞助：*

摄录赞助商可提供其记录设备和时间来帮助记录一次沙龙活动，并在活动结束后公开发布。

== Getting Started

Send us an email jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com to get started. Let us know the
city in which you’d like to host the JAM. Our team will create a meetup page on
meetup.com and we will work with you to organize your JAM.

*JAM Support*

* Swag - We will send you cool swags (stickers, t-shirts, Jenkins bobble-heads, etc) to share with members
* Promote - We give every JAM continuous social media love via Twitter, blog posts, Facebook, newsletter, and post on the jenkinsci.org events calendar.
* Jenkins Expertise - We will help you to schedule a Jenkins expert as the key speaker at your JAM, or provide you with presentation materials.
* Outreach - We will assist in reaching out to your local community for food/venue sponsorship.

=== Best Practices

* Attend existing meetup groups to gauge Jenkins interest/market within your area.
* Reach out to existing JAM organizer(s) to learn best practices and time commitment.
* Set up a Twitter account (for example, #JenkinsNYC). Email your group’s Twitter ID to jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com so we can help to promote your JAM.
* Promote, tweet and post your JAM in advance.
* Avoid product pitches. Keep it real, it’s not about promotions. This is about - and for - learning opportunities for the community.
* Shake up the format. Have presentations, panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, hackathons, etc.
* Set a consistent date, time and location so members will plan for it. Avoid cancelling your meeting as people will lose faith and stop RSVPing for your JAM.

=== Stepping Down

In the event you can no longer be a JAM organizer, we ask that you nominate a
replacement organizer in your place. If this is not possible please send email
to jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com, we will work with you to find a replacement.

== Supporting a JAM

If you are not able to be a JAM organizer, speakers, food or venue, or recording sponsors are always needed. If your company is interested in sponsoring any of these items pls email jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com or reach out to the local JAM organizer via meetup.com or fill out link:https://docs.google.com/a/cloudbees.com/forms/d/1dGpwxpwoJDHR3fTlIcFXO8GZVpx5i_dWUlbi9LKolX4/edit[this form]. 

*Benefits of Being a Food or Venue or Recording Sponsor:*

* Logo and link on the meetup page.
* Verbal acknowledgement at the opening/closing remark by the host.
* Sponsor table at the meeting to display collaterals, signage, swag.
* Opportunity to host a drawing.
* Mention in social media.
* A two minute talk to address the attendees.

*Food Sponsor:*

Sponsor food and beverages for the specific month's meetup. The cost is about
$200 to $600 depending on the number of attendees. The money is used to
purchase pizza, soft drinks and paperware. One sponsor is needed for each
monthly meeting.

*Venue Sponsor:*

Venue sponsors provide the facility to host the meeting for free. One venue sponsor is needed per meeting. A meeting room with chairs and a couple of six feet tables with open space for food/beverages and mingling would be sufficient. Access to a public bathroom would be needed as well. A meetup will need such equipments as projection and screen. In the event where a meeting has more than 50 attendees an audio system will be needed.
