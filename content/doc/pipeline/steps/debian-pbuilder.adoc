=== +debianPbuilder+: Debian Pbuilder
++++
<ul><li><code>additionalBuildResults</code> (optional)
<div><p> When running a build in the chroot environment, there are occasionally files that you must retrieve from the chroot that are not part of the normal build. For example, some files that you may need to get back would include test results, auto-generated files, etc.<br> <br> Set this variable in order to get the files back from the chroot build environment.<br> <br> The files that are retrieved will also automatically be archived as well with the other build results.<br> <br> This must be a comma-separated list; spaces are allowed. </p></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>String</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>architecture</code> (optional)
<div><p> The architecture to build this as. <br> <br> If the project is using the Matrix Build plugin, leave this blank (the architectures to build for are defined by the 'architecture' environment variable). <br> <br> This is mostly to support Pipeline, however it can be used as a normal parameter as well. </p></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>String</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>buildAsTag</code> (optional)
<div><p> Set this to mark this as building a tag. When a build comes from a tag, the deb version does not get incremented(i.e. it is exactly as set in the debian/changelog file). If using SVN, this plugin automatically looks at the SVN_URL_1 environment variable to see if the string "tags/" exists. If it does, the build will act as though this parameter is set. If using Git, this plugin automatically looks at the GIT_BRANCH environment variable to see if the string "tags/" exists. If it does, the build will act as though this parameter is set. Alternatively, you can also set the environment variable DEB_PBUILDER_BUILDING_TAG to either true or false. </p></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>boolean</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>debianDirLocation</code> (optional)
<div><div> 
 <p>The location of the debian/ directory, relative to workspace root</p> 
 <p>This may also be set globally</p> 
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>String</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>distribution</code> (optional)
<div><div> 
 <p>The distribution to build for. By default, this checks the distribution that is set in debian/changelog. If the version in the changelog is UNRELEASED, it attempts to use the currently running distribution if this parameter is NULL or a 0-length string.</p> 
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>String</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>mirrorSite</code> (optional)
<div><div> 
 <p>The mirror site to use. If this is not set or a 0-length string, then the default mirror site for this distribution will be used. The default mirror site is defined in /etc/pbuilderrc</p> 
</div></div>

<ul><li><b>Type:</b> <code>String</code></li></ul></li>
<li><code>numberCores</code> (optional)
<div><div> 
 <p>The number of cores to use when building. By default, this is 1. Set to -1 in order to use as many cores as possible when building. In order for this to take effect, you need to make sure that your debian/rules is setup properly. See <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/337093/how-to-run-parallel-make-with-debuild" rel="nofollow"> this post.</a></p>
