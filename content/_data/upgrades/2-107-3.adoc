==== Jenkins user database no longer allows user signup with unsafe characters

link:/security/advisory/2018-05-09/#SECURITY-786[SECURITY-786]

The Jenkins user database now restricts user names for user signup.
Only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters are allowed.

To change what user names are legal, set the system property `hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm.ID_REGEX` to a regular expression that any legal user name must match.
