[#SECURITY-1491]
==== Improved CSRF protection

link:/security/advisory/2019-08-28/#SECURITY-1491[SECURITY-1491]

Jenkins 2.176.3 and 2.192 introduce further improvements to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF] protection.
This increases the likelihood of using CSRF tokens in a way that is no longer supported.
The previous upgrade advice for link:#SECURITY-626[SECURITY-626] in 2.176.2 applies.
